    <h1>
        Croissant
    </h1>
    <p>Croissants are not originally from France, despite being strongly associated with French cuisine. Croissants actually have their origins in Austria. They are said to have been created in the late 17th century in Vienna to celebrate the Austrian victory over the Ottoman Empire. The croissant's distinctive crescent shape is thought to have been inspired by the crescent moon on the Ottoman flag. It was later popularized in France and became an integral part of French bakeries and breakfast culture. So, while we commonly think of croissants as French, their history has Austrian roots. </p>
